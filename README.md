A  cellular automaton simulation that models human social behavior and group dynamics. This  simulation explores emergent patterns in social contagion, demonstrating how individual interactions create complex population-level behaviors.

## Features

-  **Real-time Visualization**: Watch behavior patterns emerge and evolve dynamically
-  **Complex Social Rules**: Individual and group-based interactions with realistic probability models
-  **Population Dynamics**: Advanced birth, death, conversion, and migration mechanics
-  **Interactive Controls**: Toggle kill mechanics, pause simulation, adjust simulation speed
-  **Statistical Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of population changes and behavioral shifts
-  **Overpopulation Management**: Intelligent population control with crowding-based selection algorithms

##  Installation

###  Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ 
- pip package manager 

### 🔧 Dependencies
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

### ⚡ Quick Start
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd human-behavior-simulation
python simulation.py
```

##  How It Works

### Cell Types
- ** Red (Bad)**: Represents negative behaviors or attitudes
- ** Green (Good)**: Represents positive behaviors or attitudes  
- ** Black**: Empty space

### ⚔ Interaction Rules

####  Individual Interactions
- **Good vs Bad encounters**:
  - 3+ Bad neighbors → 75% kill Good, 25% convert to Bad
  - 2 Bad neighbors → 50% kill, 50% convert
  - 1 Bad neighbor → 50% chance both become same type

- **Bad vs Good encounters**:
  - 3+ Good neighbors → 90% convert Bad to Good, 10% kill
  - 2 Good neighbors → Convert Bad to Good
  - 1 Good neighbor → 50% chance both become same type

####  Group Dynamics
- ** Large Groups** (4+ connected cells): Enhanced reproductive capabilities
  -  Bad groups: 60% spawn probability
  -  Good groups: 30% spawn probability
- **⚔ Group Competition**: Strategic elimination of isolated opposing individuals

#### Population Control
- **Maximum Density**: 40% of total grid capacity
- ** Overpopulation Events**: Advanced crowding algorithms with weighted elimination
- ** Random Movement**: Stochastic migration patterns to nearby vacant spaces

### Special Mechanics
- ** Isolation Death**: Homogeneous environments create 10% mortality risk
- ** Random Conversion**: 1% spontaneous behavioral transformation probability
- ** Kill Toggle**: Configurable death mechanics (converts lethal events to conversions)

## Controls

| Key/Action | Function | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **R** |  Reset | Initialize new simulation |
| **SPACE** | ⏯ Pause/Resume | Toggle simulation state |
| **+/=** |  Speed Up | Increase iteration rate |
| **-** |  Slow Down | Decrease iteration rate |
| ** Click Toggle** | Kill Mode | Enable/Disable elimination mechanics |

## Configuration

Parameters can be customized in `simulation.py`:

```python
CELL_SIZE = 4           #  Visual rendering scale
GRID_WIDTH = 200        #  Horizontal grid dimensions  
GRID_HEIGHT = 150       #  Vertical grid dimensions
MAX_POPULATION = 40%    #  Maximum sustainable density
INITIAL_POPULATION = 15% #  Starting population ratio
```
